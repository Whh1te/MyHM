1. Design a java interface called Move
   It contains one method:
      void execute(ReversiModel model)

2. Design a class called PutDiscMove that implements Move.
   It has one constructor: PutDiscMove(int row, int col)

3. Design a class called PassMove that implements Move.

4. Design a Java interface called Player containing one methods:
   Move getMove(ReversiModel model)
    It accepts one parameter ReversiModel and returns a Move.

5. Design a class called HumanPlayer that implements Player interface.
   In its implementation of getMove, it may read input from keyboard and
   returns corresponding Move.

6.  Design a class called AIPlayer that implements Player interface.
    In its implementation of getMove, it may use AI algorithm to return
    the best Move that the algorithm thinks have better chance to win.

7. Example code to player the game.
   ReversiModel model = new ReversiModelImplementation();
   model.startGame(6, Disc.white);
   ReversiTextView reversiTextView = new ReversiTextView(model);
   Player humanPlayer = new HumanPlayer();
   Player aiPlayer = new AIPlayer();

   int i=0;
   while(!model.isGameOver()) {

      Move move;
      if(i % 2 == 0) {
         move = humanPlayer.getMove(model);
      }else{
         move = aiPlayer.getMove(model);
      }

      move.execute(model);
      System.out.println(reversiTextView);

      i += 1;
   }
